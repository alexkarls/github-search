# GitHub Search (API experimentation)

Experimental application created to experiment with GitHub API and UI Component Libraries. In this stage the application allows users to search for GitHub usernames and see a rendered view of their profile and latest repositories. There is so much more you can do with the GitHub API and in the current state the application barely scratches the surface.

The application is built with React and utilizes the latest features such as Hooks and Context. The UI is built with components from [Ant Design](https://ant.design/). While creating this application I've experimented with both UI libraries and CSS frameworks as practise.
